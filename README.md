Resources
---------

*Category Theory* (second edition) by Awodey. [Errata available](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/CT2errata2010.pdf). Main book.

*Categories for the Working Mathematician* by Mac Lane. Often mentioned (it even has an own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_for_the_Working_Mathematician)), but probably not at an appropriate level for this group (most are not "working mathematicians").

*Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists* by Pierce.

*Conceptual mathematics* by Lawvere and Schanuel. "Conceptual Mathematics is a good starting place; lots of pictures. A fairly strong emphasis on sets too, rather than the topos/group examples that abound in Awodey." -- Wiegley

Various other opinions from the Internet: [Smith](http://www.logicmatters.net/2008/06/08/awodeys-category-theory-ch-1/) is concerned about Awodey's book being too advanced for many readers, and instead suggests *Sets for Mathematics* or *Topoi: The Categorial Analysis of Logic* (see the blog comment section). See also [his page with a long list of resources](http://www.logicmatters.net/categories/), where he links his "relatively accessible" introduction (and reading guidelines "for philosophers").

Other courses:

* [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) by Milewski
* [Oregon Programming Languages Summer School](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer12/curriculum.html)
* [Cambridge course Category Theory, Type Theory and Logic](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L108/), cs-oriented course with lecture notes available (at least for previous iterations)
